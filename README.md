### 🚀 My Best AI Project: RaDix

  The heart of RaDix is a robust deep learning model built with PyTorch, trained on extensive chest X-ray datasets to accurately identify a variety of thoracic diseases. What makes RaDix unique is its ability to automatically generate detailed diagnostic reports and relevant tags, streamlining the diagnostic process and providing actionable insights for medical professionals.

To ensure accessibility and scalability, we deployed the backend on Hugging Face Spaces, enabling secure, cloud-based inference for users anywhere in the world. The frontend, developed using React.js, delivers a clean and intuitive interface for uploading X-rays and viewing results. Our backend infrastructure combines Node.js, Express.js, and FastAPI to provide seamless API integration and high-performance data processing.

Firebase plays a central role in RaDix, serving as the backbone for both data storage and user authentication. This choice allowed us to implement real-time updates and ensure secure, reliable access to medical data, while simplifying the overall architecture.

Leading RaDix was an invaluable experience that deepened my expertise in deploying machine learning models, building scalable web applications, and managing a multidisciplinary team. The project stands as a testament to my commitment to leveraging AI for real-world impact and my ability to guide a team from concept to deployment in a high-stakes domain like healthcare.
